TO DO 
1. Implement Bottleneck Transformer in Tensorflow 
2. Prepare Imagenet for Training (use instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012)
3. Train and Compare Bottleneck Resnet and Resnet on Imagenet 
4. Prepare a medical dataset for training 
5. Train and Compare Bottleneck Resnet and Resnet on medical dataset 


# Project Title
## Overview



## Background and Motivation

## Goals
Implement Bottleneck Transformers as described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11605. After implementation, reproduce results on ILSVRC2012. After reproduction, test Bottleneck Transformers on a medical dataset. 

## Datasets
ILSVRC2012
https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/
https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification


## Practical Applications
Use of Bottleneck Transformers in computer vision tasks in the medical domain.
